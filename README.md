2D Strategy Game 


This is a project for the KU Leuven. This project is being developped for the course Object Oriented Programming.
I left the old code in the source folder, so that we might take pieces from that one, if they would turn out to be more effective. The updates are just source files that are further progressed than the original source files.
Please do not delete the old files, because of the reason mentioned above.
